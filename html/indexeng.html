    <p>
        The National VideoGame Museum is the place to be for everyone who wants to know more (and experience) about the history,
        social and cultural side of video games.
        The museum also lets its visitors experience the games of tomorrow.
        Gamers young and old are welcome to play, discover, learn and share experiences online.

    <p>
        A garage box in The Hague is the place where the adventure started in 2008, 
        with two friends Hasan Tasdemir and Pascal Rappailles. 
        The garage quickly became too small, after which they moved to a warehouse on an industrial estate. 
        Unfortunately, the shed was not heated and everything had to be transferred to an empty Ministry of Agriculture in the middle of winter. 
        When this building also had to be cleared out, the then collection of 10 arcade video games was stored with some spare parts in an old showroom for classic cars. 
        Because there was no room to renovate or play with the cabinets, suitable space was looked for. 
        It was found in 2011 on the Cobaltstraat in Zoetermeer. 
        There Hasan decided to rent the location with 4 friends and the adventure could grow into their own meeting place to practice their hobby and relax with a game.

    </p>
        
    <h4>Insert  Coin</h4>
    <p>
        Soon there were more people who wanted to join,
        as a result of which both the location and the hobby approach were no longer sufficient,
        next to everyone's daily work.
        The initiative was in danger of collapsing because of its success.
        It was therefore decided by the friends that a professional approach was necessary and it could no longer be continued as a hobby.
        In good consultation it was decided that one of the friends,
        Hasan Tasdemir would try to develop the concept into a company.
        The others would support him with advice and deed in their free time.
        Hasan decided to leave Cobaltstraat in 2014 and move to Bleiswijkseweg.
        Because the income was still marginal, only anti-squat buildings could be rented,
        resulting in frequent relocation.
        From Stephensonstraat to Edisonstraat where great events under the name Retro Planet were organized for the community.
        The collection was also expanded further and further.
        While the interest in retrogaming from family and friends grew and grew.
        That is why Hasan took the important step in 2015 to house his now extensive collection in a professional company called Playworks BV
    </p>

    <h4> EXTRA LIFE!</h4>
    <p>
        In 2016 Hasan came into contact with Jan Kragt,
        city ​​marketer of the municipality of Zoetermeer,
        deeply impressed by the collection,
        came up with the idea of ​​turning it into a museum and setting up a foundation for that purpose.
        Hasan and Jan came up with the name on the spot and the National Video Game Museum was born.
        Together with a number of important players from the Dutch game community, the National Videogame Museum Foundation was subsequently established.
        The municipal council was enthusiastic about the idea and decided to support the museum financially.
        This made it possible to rent a heated storage facility where the entire collection could be housed and some of it exhibited.
        At the beginning of 2017, a real museum location was found in close cooperation with the municipality:
        the former V&D building in the city center of Zoetermeer.
    </p>
    
    <h4>CONTINUE? YES!</h4>
    <p>
        From May 2017, a large group of volunteers and fans worked hard to get the pilot of the museum set up so that it was ready to play on December 1, 2017!
        The enormous influx of enthusiastic visitors and the many positive reactions to our museum speak for themselves.
        The National Video Game Museum has now become a great success,
        partly thanks to the unbridled efforts of all our employees and volunteers.
    </p>

    <h4>LEVEL UP</h4>
    <p>
        We are now busy enlarging the museum,
        deepening the experience and strengthening the museological and educational value of our beautiful museum.
        We are doing everything we can to further professionalize the museum and prepare it for the next 'level' at a permanent and definitive location.
        And our ambition goes much further,
        because we want the National Videogame Museum to grow into a total concept,
        with, inter alia:
        a National Game Knowledge Center;
        a National Video Game Archive;
        an eSports arena;
        A Hacker/makerspace for young and old;
        a game fair and event location

    <h3>Family Vissers</h3>
    <p>
        The video game museum has been around for less than a year and we went this weekend for the 3rd time. 
        It is a short drive from Nijmegen but it is really worth it. 
        - entrance fees are cheap - an incredible amount to do 
        - aimed at letting young and old play together 
        - nicely decorated, especially the 70's and 80's rooms 
        - everything can be touched and played 
        - very friendly and helpful staff 
        - example of a new generation museums Our son (9) is crazy about computer games and we went to such a museum in Zwolle last year. 
        He was still enjoying himself but the rest had seen it after 10 minutes. 
        What a relief the Videogame Museum in Zoetermeer is. 
        There is plenty for everyone to enjoy and almost everything you can do together. 
        Our daughters (6 and 14) have nothing to do with computers at all but went all out in the many games, especially the music and dance games. 
        Even they are already looking forward to the Christmas holidays, because then we will go again. <br></br>
        Date of activity: September 2018
